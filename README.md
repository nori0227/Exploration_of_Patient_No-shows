# data
Two datasets were provided by Professor Hants. A dataset containing car crash report from 2016-2021 was exported from Kaggle. This dataset was enriched with the baseline data on zipcode and on both zipcode and date. The two new datasets are available in the data folder.

Another new sub-dataset was created from the baseline dataset for performing visualizations utilizng Streamlit. A sub-dataset was created as the basline dataset was too large and wasn't loading in Streamlit.

# Script:
Scripts for data cleaning and enhancements are available in the folder.

The car crash dataset was enriched with the baseline dataset on zipcode, and then on zipcode and date.

Scripts for streamlit visualizations are also available in this folder along with images of visualizations.

A ML statistical analysis was conducted using the linear regression studying the effect of patient age on no show.

A traditional statistical test was conducted ---

# Insights
